# Style Transfer

What is style transferring an image? Its when you give a photograph and select a style (Van Gogh, Munch, etc), and then the content of the photograph is generated in the style of the selected art. 

My goal here is to not use external NN libraries, instead create and optimize one for myself. I know that this means the final result will not be as good as it could have been, but for that I could have just downloaded an existing app. This is about the adventure of making it!
